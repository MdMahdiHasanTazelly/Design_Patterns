# Singleton Design Pattern
- Ensures single instance: only one instance of a class can exist.
- Prevents multiple objects creation to save memory.
- Global access: provides static method to get instance.

### Two Types of Singleton design patterns are there.
**1. Eager Loading:** The instance is initialised, when the application starts.  

**2. Lazy Loading:** Instance is initialised whenever it's invoked.

   **NB: Instance will be instantiated in the same class and returned using a method.**
