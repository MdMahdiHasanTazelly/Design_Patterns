# Observer Design Pattern

This is another behavioral design pattern.
This design pattern will have SUBJECT as interface and OBSERVER as interface. The SUBJECT and OBSERVER interface will be implemented in CONCRETE SUBJECT and CONCRETE OBSERVER. The CONCRETE SUBJECT will hold all the CONCRETE OBSEREVRS notify them.

The fundamental principal of this design pattern is to notifying all the CONCRETE OBSERVERS about the changes in CONCRETE SUBJECT.
